List of design systems resources I've personally gathered over time. Includes links to tools and systems I reference regularly and research I've gathered for components or design tokens

I keep this on GitHub to access and share it more easily.

## Systems to reference<a id='referenceSystems'></a>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The list is in no order and is not intended to be another list of many systems. These are systems I frequent for ideas.

* [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/): Very useful to get a bearing when researching accessibility for a component or pattern
* [GOLD Design System](https://gold.designsystemau.org/): Good component docs docs, particularly component metadata
* [NewsKit](https://www.newskit.co.uk/): Great docs, good tokens, good ally	
* [Adobe Spectrum](https://spectrum.adobe.com/): Checklist docs and anatomy. Good token docs
* [Aviva ION (Framework)](https://standards.aviva.com/ion/): My first system. Useful for docs with live examples, component IA and showing a bespoke system that has lasted
* [Audi-Storybook](https://react.ui.audi/?path=/docs/introduction--docs): Great example of how to use just storybook for a design system site
* [Decathlon Design System](https://zeroheight.com/726f8c765/p/71b8e3-decathlon-design-system): Depricated system using Zeroheight for docs. Had/has some nice token docs
* [Wix Design System](https://www.wix-pages.com/wix-design-system-employees/?path=/story/foundations-tokens--tokens-and-theming-guide): Good example of token documentation and overall content structure using Storybook for a complete design system site
