# design-system-resources
List of design systems resources I’ve personally gathered over time. Includes links to tools and systems I reference regularly and research I've gathered for components or design tokens

I keep this on gitHub so I can access and share it more easily

## Tools to Use Regularly<a id='tools'></a>
### Accessibility
* [WCAG 2 Quick Reference](https://3pha.com/wcag2/) by [Jo Chidzik](https://twitter.com/joechidzik)

* [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/)
* [Tutorials by Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/)
* [WebAIM’s WCAG 2 Checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist)

### HTML
* [w3 Schools HTML Tutorial references](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
* [mdn web docs: HTML: HyperText Markup Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

### Component References

## Systems to reference<a id='referenceSystems'></a>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The list is in no order and is not intended to be another list of many systems. These are systems I frequent for ideas.

* [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/): Very useful to get a bearing when researching accessibility for a component or pattern
* [GOLD Design System](https://gold.designsystemau.org/): Good component docs docs, particularly component metadata
* [NewsKit](https://www.newskit.co.uk/): Great docs, good tokens, good ally	
* [Adobe Spectrum](https://spectrum.adobe.com/): Checklist docs and anatomy. Good token docs
* [Aviva ION (Framework)](https://standards.aviva.com/ion/): My first system. Useful for docs with live examples, component IA and showing a bespoke system that has lasted
* [Audi-Storybook](https://react.ui.audi/?path=/docs/introduction--docs): Great example of how to use just storybook for a design system site
* [Decathlon Design System](https://zeroheight.com/726f8c765/p/71b8e3-decathlon-design-system): Depricated system using Zeroheight for docs. Had/has some nice tokend docs

### Finding systems or components
* [A collection of awesome design systems](https://github.com/alexpate/awesome-design-systems): Compresnhive list of design systems that I use when researching 
* [GitHub - saadeghi/design-systems](https://github.com/saadeghi/design-systems): A list of famous design systems, design languages and guidelines
* [design-systems · GitHub Topics](https://github.com/topics/design-systems): Large list of public repositories
